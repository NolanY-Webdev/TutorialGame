# TutorialGame
Creating a game following youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfR09erJu7U

##Day 1
@ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgSApgveCjU

 - Current files of Ecclipse workspace for game
 - Functional game window
 - No further progress

##Day 2 or something
@ https://youtu.be/O1vQABTMMgo?t=5m54s
 - 1:48AM
 - Game sized for 1440x900 just because my system works best in that resolution.
 - Have a beautiful field of grass showing. So peaceful.

##Day 3 not much happened
  Somewhere around https://youtu.be/O1vQABTMMgo?t=14m11s
  Added map saved as int[][] (so a double array of intergers)
    sized for my devices screen, which is a peculiar ratio. I'll work on it for fun but it wont work well on other devices...

  Created randomized map2 :
    - each layout is unplayable
    - rethinking randomization in terms of a bigger chunk of grid at a time.
      - Like a tileset system.
      - Wonder if there is a way to control zoom...
      - Would be neat to have a tower defense map that is built upon as it is played...

  Dont entirely remember where the video was going on or what had happened.

##Day 4ish
  Didn't work though weekend, spent some time playing some other games for ideas.
  Hadn't logged day 3 so spent the morning of day 4 writing that and catching up.
  Going to commit log and eat while coffee kicks in. Then I'll figure out where I'm at. Think I need to get out of the rabbit hole and just follow the video.

  Got my map to match the one in the video as well, figured it was best for learning. At least I know I can easily change things around in my own way. Perhaps I will learn a better method in the future.

  First enemy to show on screen, committing progress.

  Clock helper implemented, understood to an extent but not completely.
  Enemy can now move slightly.

  Got enemy wave class creation working.


  @ https://youtu.be/wn9YK2oVcI0?list=PLFUqwj4q1Zr8GHs6bO4d6gxMGUh_2pcNg
  Everything working and up to date with latest video.

  Adding logic to pathing.


##Day 5
  little burnt, really didn't get anything done
  consider it a personal mental health day

##Day 6
  @ https://youtu.be/wn9YK2oVcI0?t=28m0s
  got code directly matching video
  everything functional at that point.

  @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLBGr6Co3BQ
  code all caught up to video

  @ https://youtu.be/LLBGr6Co3BQ?t=7m18s
  somewhere near where I had ended

##Day 7 and 8
  stuff got done, on video 30 now

  have been trying to work off projector and that has made this log a bit more out of the way in terms of verifying im on the right youtube link and all. Tower base tiles have been implemented spawned in the same fashion enemies are.

  Interesting later project would be to recreate minecraft or a similar more stupid clone. Perhaps design any sort of 3d project that would allow the user to expolore to some extent.
