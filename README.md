# TutorialGame
Creating a game following youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfR09erJu7U

##Day 1
@ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgSApgveCjU

 - Current files of Ecclipse workspace for game
 - Functional game window
 - No further progress

##Day 2 or something
@ https://youtu.be/O1vQABTMMgo?t=5m54s
 - 1:48AM
 - Game sized for 1440x900 just because my system works best in that resolution.
 - Have a beautiful field of grass showing. So peaceful.

##Day 3 not much happened
  Somewhere around https://youtu.be/O1vQABTMMgo?t=14m11s
  Added map saved as int[][] (so a double array of intergers)
    sized for my devices screen, which is a peculiar ratio. I'll work on it for fun but it wont work well on other devices...

  Created randomized map2 :
    - each layout is unplayable
    - rethinking randomization in terms of a bigger chunk of grid at a time.
      - Like a tileset system.
      - Wonder if there is a way to control zoom...
      - Would be neat to have a tower defense map that is built upon as it is played...

  Dont entirely remember where the video was going on or what had happened.

##Day 4ish
  Didn't work though weekend, spent some time playing some other games for ideas.
  Hadn't logged day 3 so spent the morning of day 4 writing that and catching up.
  Going to commit log and eat while coffee kicks in. Then I'll figure out where I'm at. Think I need to get out of the rabbit hole and just follow the video.

  got my map to match the one in the video as well, figured it was best for learning. At least I know I can easily change things around in my own way. Perhaps I will learn a better method in the future.
