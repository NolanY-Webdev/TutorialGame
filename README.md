# TutorialGame
Creating a game following youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfR09erJu7U

##Day 1
@ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgSApgveCjU

 - Current files of Ecclipse workspace for game
 - Functional game window
 - No further progress

##Day 2 or something
@ https://youtu.be/O1vQABTMMgo?t=5m54s
 - 1:48AM
 - Game sized for 1440x900 just because my system works best in that resolution.
 - Have a beautiful field of grass showing. So peaceful.

##Day 3 not much happened
  Somewhere around https://youtu.be/O1vQABTMMgo?t=14m11s
  Added map saved as int[][] (so a double array of intergers)
    sized for my devices screen, which is a peculiar ratio. I'll work on it for fun but it wont work well on other devices...

  Created randomized map2 :
    - each layout is unplayable
    - rethinking randomization in terms of a bigger chunk of grid at a time.
      - Like a tileset system.
      - Wonder if there is a way to control zoom...
      - Would be neat to have a tower defense map that is built upon as it is played...

  Dont entirely remember where the video was going on or what had happened.

##Day 4ish
  Didn't work though weekend, spent some time playing some other games for ideas.
  Hadn't logged day 3 so spent the morning of day 4 writing that and catching up.
  Going to commit log and eat while coffee kicks in. Then I'll figure out where I'm at. Think I need to get out of the rabbit hole and just follow the video.

  Got my map to match the one in the video as well, figured it was best for learning. At least I know I can easily change things around in my own way. Perhaps I will learn a better method in the future.

  First enemy to show on screen, committing progress.

  @ https://youtu.be/g4OwOcKq148?t=14m31s
  Clock helper implemented, understood to an extent but not completely.
  Enemy can now move slightly.

  @ https://youtu.be/g4OwOcKq148?t=21m17s
  Got enemy wave class creation working.


  @ https://youtu.be/wn9YK2oVcI0?list=PLFUqwj4q1Zr8GHs6bO4d6gxMGUh_2pcNg
  Everything working and up to date with latest video.

  @ https://youtu.be/wn9YK2oVcI0?t=6m2s
  Adding logic to pathing.


##Day 5
  not feeling so good, really didn't get anything done
  consider it a personal health day

##Day 6
  @ https://youtu.be/wn9YK2oVcI0?t=28m0s
  got code directly matching video
  everything functional at that point.

  @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLBGr6Co3BQ
  code all caught up to video

  @ https://youtu.be/LLBGr6Co3BQ?t=7m18s
  somewhere near where I had ended

##Day 7/8
  stuff* got done, on video 30 now
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jOhfVt9PZc
  have been trying to work off projector and that has made this log a bit more out of the way in terms of verifying im on the right youtube link and all. Tower base tiles have been implemented spawned in the same fashion enemies are.

  Interesting later project would be to recreate minecraft or a similar, if not stupider, clone. Perhaps design any sort of 3d project that would allow the user to expolore to some extent. Maybe even reuse the amazing textures from this game or something.
          (*Stuff: some bug fixes and the base tile level of towers)

## Day 9 (I think?)
  https://youtu.be/S-WiE_O4zjM?t=4m11s
  Worked a bit over the weekend and this morning. Not a ton but kept up the rythm of working more and more. Need to keep logging everything. Aim is to get really far and log a lot today.

    -More random ideas, Pandora radio remote control app.

  https://youtu.be/S-WiE_O4zjM?t=5m50s
  not much video progress but much personal
    BRANCHING FROM VIDEO, NOTE TOWER DIFFERENCES added fireRate and projectileSpeed to tower construction and passing variables directly to Projectile class.

    don't quite agree with how he is setting up the Wave/WaveManager but I'll follow along for now

  that last episode was a bit of a nightmare, strayed from video and got a bit lost, code seems up to par with video minus tower deviations made before. So much hopping around randomly last time. Guess it's good practice at the least.


  https://youtu.be/XRcmPVsi9V4?t=20s
  Got waves implemented to an extent.

  https://youtu.be/e3-TZ7TfJjA?t=23s
  Towers are tracking enemies now, not firing in correct direction though
